Dashboard 1:This dashboard shows a cool look at how start time changes based on birth year from the 2015 statistics. Most start times are around 6 pm but in certain earlier years, notably the mid-1960Õs, the highest used start time is actually much earlier, usually in the morning. It also shows the trip duration based on birth year- with 1985 being by far the highest.Dashboard 2: This dashboard shows the same graphs but from updated 2020 statistics, to show how it has changed over time. The most interesting finding to me in this dashboard is that the highest trip duration birth year in 2020 is actually 1969 by a large amount. A very large 16 year difference between the 2. The average rider is actually trending older, when you might expect the opposite.Dashboard 3 and Story 1: This dashboard and Story allows you to select a station from the top map and it will populate the average birth year. The farther east you go, the younger the birth year trends. Upon making a selection, map two will tell you the average trip duration, which is very sporadic looking upon initial glance.
